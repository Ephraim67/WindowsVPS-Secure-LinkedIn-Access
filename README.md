### **Setting Up a Windows VPS for Secure LinkedIn Access**  

Setting up a Windows VPS that allows multiple users to log into LinkedIn securely while avoiding security flags.  

---

## **Step 1: Choosing the Right VPS Provider**  

### **Recommended Providers:**  
- **Vultr** – Reliable, offers static IP, affordable hourly billing.  
- **Kamatera** – Great performance, flexible scaling.  
- **OVH/Contabo/Hetzner** – Affordable alternatives, but ensure they allow RDP access.
- **AWS EC2 / Vultr / Kamatera** - as the VPS provider.

### **Key Considerations:**  
- Choose a plan with at least **2 vCPUs, 4GB RAM**, and **Windows Server** pre-installed.  
- Ensure the provider offers a **dedicated/static IP** to prevent LinkedIn security issues.  
- Select a **server location** closest to your usual browsing location for minimal flagging.

## **Step 2: Setting Up the Windows VPS**  

### **1. Deploy the VPS**  
- Sign up and create a new VPS instance with **Windows Server 2019/2022**.  
- Assign a **static IP** (most providers allow this in network settings).  
- Note the **admin credentials** provided by the VPS provider.  

### **2. Enable Remote Desktop (RDP) Access**  
- Connect to the VPS using **Remote Desktop Connection (RDP)** from your local computer.  
- Open **System Properties** → **Remote Settings** → Enable **Allow Remote Connections**.  
- In **Windows Firewall**, allow inbound traffic for **RDP (port 3389)**.  

### **3. Create Separate User Accounts for Multi-User RDP**  
By default, Windows Server allows only one RDP session. To allow multiple users:  
- Open **Computer Management** → **Local Users and Groups** → **Users**.  
- Add a new user account for your VA (e.g., `VAUser`).  
- Assign a strong password and **add the user to the "Remote Desktop Users" group**.  

To enable multiple RDP sessions:  
- Run **gpedit.msc** → Navigate to **Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Remote Desktop Services > Remote Desktop Session Host > Connections**.  
- Enable **"Restrict Remote Desktop Services users to a single Remote Desktop Services session"** and set it to **Disabled**.  

Alternatively, install **RDP Wrapper** to bypass the single-session limit.

## **Step 3: Ensuring LinkedIn Security**  

### **1. Prevent Security Flags by Keeping IP Consistent**  
- Ensure the VPS uses a **static IP**.  
- Avoid frequently changing server locations.  

### **2. Configure Browser to Reduce Tracking**  
- Install **Google Chrome** on the VPS.  
- Disable **WebRTC leaks** (install a WebRTC-blocking extension).  
- Use a **consistent browser profile** to prevent LinkedIn fingerprinting.  

### **3. Match Local Settings to Avoid Suspicion**  
- Set the **VPS timezone** to match your normal browsing location.  
- Configure the **Windows language and keyboard layout** accordingly.  

### **4. Optional: Use a Residential Proxy/VPN for Extra Security**  
- If LinkedIn still flags logins, use a **residential proxy** or VPN that matches your usual region.

## **Step 4: Deliverables**  

Once everything is set up, ensure you provide the following:  

**Fully configured Windows VPS** with RDP multi-user access.  
**Pre-installed Google Chrome** with security settings optimized.  
**RDP login details** for both you and your VA.  
**Step-by-step guide** (text or Loom video) on accessing the VPS.

## **Budget Considerations**  

- **VPS Cost**: $15-$40/month (varies by provider).  
- **Setup Time**: Takes about **2-4 hours** for a skilled freelancer.  
- **Budget**: $30-$50 is tight but feasible if an experienced freelancer has pre-configured automation scripts.
